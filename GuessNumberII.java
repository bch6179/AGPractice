[LeetCode] Guess Number Higher or Lower II 猜数字大小之二
 

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

Hint:

The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could possibly face. Another strategy is to minimize the expected loss. Here, we are interested in thefirst scenario.
Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
Check out this article if you're still stuck.
The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a small n. You MUST use dynamic programming.
As a follow-up, how would you modify your code to solve the problem of minimizing the expected loss, instead of the worst-case loss?

此题是之前那道Guess Number Higher or Lower的拓展，难度增加了不少，根据题目中的提示，这道题需要用到Minimax极小化极大算法，关于这个算法可以参见这篇讲解，并且题目中还说明了要用DP来做，那么我们需要建立一个二维的dp数组，其中dp[i][j]表示从数字i到j之间猜中任意一个数字最少需要花费的钱数，那么我们需要遍历每一段区间[j, i]，维护一个全局最小值global_min变量，然后遍历该区间中的每一个数字，计算局部最大值local_max = k + max(dp[j][k - 1], dp[k + 1][i])，这个正好是将该区间在每一个位置都分为两段，然后取当前位置的花费加上左右两段中较大的花费之和为局部最大值，然后更新全局最小值，最后在更新dp[j][i]的时候看j和i是否是相邻的，相邻的话赋为i，否则赋为global_min，参见代码如下：

public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = i - 1; j > 0; --j) {
                int global_min = INT_MAX;
                for (int k = j + 1; k < i; ++k) {
                    int local_max = k + max(dp[j][k - 1], dp[k + 1][i]);
                    global_min = min(global_min, local_max);
                }
                dp[j][i] = j + 1 == i ? j : global_min;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
