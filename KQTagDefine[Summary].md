search min in equalable rotated arrays
#QuickPrune: if you feel a bit hard  ,filter  first,
find the tie of the problem, duplicate -> two direction, either solve this
directly by reaching out two branch; or from other property of the problem, only two ends are duplicate if phasing it, then you could just skip those from two end just like quick sort 

rotated search target
#LessCases:is there other approach? which approach makes less cases, which statement leads to decisive result and others go to elses

#BackStepSeeAnother
:from the cons of preivous or similar approach, find another solution fit for the new concern, like min don't care ..., but target introduces more cases; original comparison with the end make one more cases, why not compare with the start point with middle.

#CoverElseSolution:
AntiAttempToDrawCripy:
