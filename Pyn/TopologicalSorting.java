Topological Sorting

25% Accepted
Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.

Example
For graph as follow:

The topological order can be:

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
[0, 2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
...
