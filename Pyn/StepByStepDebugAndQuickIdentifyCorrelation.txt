step by step debug for js; not knowing when it will break

Ajax: can just send a message in I.e. instead of seeing  Login in HTml

Quickly corelate this with why not work

after this working, then pass Ajax in DataTable

Look for DataTable API when seeing messing data and wrapped inner variables - might other way to do instead of stucking in figuring out why data not decoded

Not clickiable: move things out to new js, and loaded in service request html, so don't mess up the accecontrol js: need to take care of alert dataTable as well;Not sure Datatable or dataTable look at jquery.dataTable.js 

Jason data:xxxx, change to dataset.data then it will work ; google search and check error info, not  find sth..

style error look at the stack 

add accecontrol class to .dataTable class variables
